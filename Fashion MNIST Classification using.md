Fashion MNIST Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Project Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying the Fashion MNIST dataset using Keras. 
The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of fashion items. 
The goal is to train a CNN model to accurately classify these images into 10 categories and make predictions for at least two images.

Directory Structure
fashion_mnist_cnn_python.py: Python code for building and training the CNN using Keras and TensorFlow.
fashion_mnist_cnn_r.R: R code for building and training the CNN using Keras.



Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)
R (version 3.5 or higher)
Keras and TensorFlow for both Python and R


Running the Model
Python Code
Once the script is run, the model will:

Load and preprocess the Fashion MNIST dataset.
Build and compile the CNN model with six layers.
Train the model for 5 epochs.
Evaluate the model on the test dataset and output the accuracy.
Make predictions for two images from the test set and print the predicted labels.
R Code
The R script follows a similar workflow:

Load and preprocess the Fashion MNIST dataset.
Build and compile the CNN model with six layers.
Train the model for 5 epochs.
Evaluate the model on the test dataset and output the accuracy.
Make predictions for two images from the test set and display the predicted labels.
